                    The Tsunami Warning Centers depend on an observation system that includes seismic and water-level networks from around the world to help them determine when and where to issue tsunami messages. These networks are critical to the warning centersâ€™ ability to provide timely and accurate message.

            <p><b>Although tsunamis cannot be prevented, there are 
                things you can do before a tsunami that could save your 
                life and the lives of your family and friends. Importantly, 
                find out if your home, school, workplace, or other places you 
                visit often are in a tsunami hazard zone.There are two ways 
                that you may be warned that a tsunami is coming: an official tsunami 
                warning and a natural tsunami warning. Both are equally important. 
                You may not get both.</b></p>

            <p><b>Put together a portable disaster supplies kit with items you and your family (including pets) may need in an emergency. Prepare kits for work and cars, too.If buildings have to be built, then it is better to make them higher, so that water can flow under them. They would then have suspended floors. If the suspended floors are concrete with suitable framing, their weight and integrity can combat some of the force of the wave.

                Although the most common cause of death associated with these disasters is drowning, tsunami aftermath poses other risks, including.Receding water affecting structures and carrying debris.Widespread flooding.Contamination of drinking water.Fires from gas lines or ruptured tanks.
