                    The Tsunami Warning Centers depend on an observation system that includes seismic and water-level networks from around the world to help them determine when and where to issue tsunami messages. These networks are critical to the warning centersâ€™ ability to provide timely and accurate message.

            <p><b>Although tsunamis cannot be prevented, there are 
                things you can do before a tsunami that could save your 
                life and the lives of your family and friends. Importantly, 
                find out if your home, school, workplace, or other places you 
                visit often are in a tsunami hazard zone.There are two ways 
                that you may be warned that a tsunami is coming: an official tsunami 
                warning and a natural tsunami warning. Both are equally important. 
                You may not get both.</b></p>
